        <h1>What is Microsoft Teams?</h1>
            <p>Microsoft Teams is a messaging app that uses chat instead of
            email and channels instead of file folders. It is a workspace 
            for you and your team to securely edits files at the same time 
            and where all conversations, meetings, files, and notes can be
            accessed by everyone, all in one place no matter where you are.</p>

        <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
        <p>We use it to communicate with our faculty, staff, and students over
        the web for web based learning in order to comply with social distancing 
        factors and be able to offer students and faculty a safe way to communicate 
        effectively. </p>

        <h1>What are teams?</h1>
        <p>Teams are made up of a select group of people within an organization coming
        together to get tasks done like projects, meetings, and etc. </p>
